Joined to create web services, doing fine, but couldn't get data or folk to integrate with the new services.
Asked: What team is struggling the most that I could helo out?
Turns out you can't help every team. They hated me. Very set in their ways.

So I asked, what the second most struggling team. And that is this story.

PICTURE THE SCENE!

* The PO has quit
* Three devs are working on nine cards simultaneously
* Stand-ups are scheduled for every second Monday
