# Context

* PO quit
* Standups once every second week
* Tried adding more people - database lost data - people worked on boxing day
* Ancient tech
* Every time the code built we'd get popup for a license twice
* No CI, a handful of broken tests
* multi-k class files
* A core lib, that was reused everywhere
* releases that are manual off the svn logs
* No test environment
* 4 devs - 8 cars in process. Some for months
* No analytics, no error tracking
* Don't remove the cache! Bad things can happen
* UI design unchanged from 2001
* not a single keyboard shortcut used. Mouse driven dev

# Some successes

* BDD (tester joined)
* How can we help the biz, help themselves "they never give us the right requirements"
