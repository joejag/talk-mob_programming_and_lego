# Intro

* Hello!
* Two ideas for effectiveness and efficiency
 * Mob: collaborate over communicate
 * Lego: Powerful retrospective technique
* Via a story

# Glasgow

* My home.
* In Glasgow, HQ AC, 300k cars

# keys

* 1 year in, new challenge -> hate -> need to be welcomed -> P.O.S.
* Recently had a bad experience over Christmas

# Paint brushes

* PO Quit
* 3 devs on 9 stories -> Standup fortnightly as nothing changed

# Technical Mess

* 0.5m LoC. Converted from VB. Thousand line classes, hundred line methods.
* Broken tests
* No CI, manual deploy
* Let's rewrite! Not until behaviour fixed

# Try to fix

* Rename method -> Class library
* Analytics -> Took out production
* Silo'd knowledge

# Rock the boat

* Years via Pairing
* Sometimes you have to make drastic steps. You need to rock the boat

# Mob Programming

* Limit your team
* One story? Whole team?

# Hands up

* History of counter intuitive ideas
* Absurd: Pair programming -> bottleneck isn't typing speed
* Absurd: TDD -> Create safety via a feedback loop
* Absurd: Mobs

# Woody quote

* All folk, same time, thing, space, computer.
* I know what your thinking!

# Kim mad

* All those eyes! Typo guy, keyboard guy, good name for a method?

# Kim happy

* It's not like this. More joyful experience with safety built in.
* Solving problems with smallest amount of code possible.
* Binoculars

# Video

# Timer

* Take turns. 7 minutes is sweet spot
* Not driving, more typist with mob direction

# Strong pairing quote

* For an idea to go from your brain to the computer, you have to use someone elses hands
* "I have an idea - give me" -> "I have an idea - please take the keyboard"

# Strong pairing quote - make it easy

* Know your rule/example. Write it on whiteboard
* Speak at the highest level
* Trust the mob

# Safety

* Putting ourselves out there.
* Handle conflict. Attack idea not person
* Take a time out. Contributing or learning. Watch for this.

# Size

* 3 or more. Million folk. 4 devs plus tester etc.
* Get together for bigger items

# Why

* Waste in software: context switching, blockers, queues of work
* Better software: minimal amount of code required. One person to keep the quality.
 * Code style. 10 devs, 10 idea, all in codebase. test?
* Getting things done, with high quality using the diversity of your team.

# How can I get started

* Here's some essential tips

# The mob programming working agreement

* It's not a meeting
* co-working space: desks are made for individuals. Big monitor, comfy seating. Design for communication not isolation.
* Limit WIP: Take 1 of existing work
* Commit to creating a safe environment: Watch out for your team
* Amplify the good: don't dwell on the bad, find something that works and do more of it.

# Glasgow

* Mobbing was making us more effective.
* Retros felt we were distracted
* Becoming more effective, but wanted to be more efficient.
* We wanted to show our stakeholders and management that we were drowning.

# Calculate and visualise

* Make nature of the work visible
* Tried whiteboard tally marks, spreadsheet.

# Lego

* Each block represents one hour of dev time
* Those blocks are made into a 3d bar chart
* Previous weeks are kept to show the variance after we try new things

# Close up

* Each work represents
* Ran out of orange!

# Daily Review

* Create bricks through the day. 4pm Review
* How can we stop this happening. use 5whys.

JOKE: Glasses. Also lego creating sad children faces.

# Glasgow interlude

* 4 weeks of data. Directors meeting
* 2 new large projects for the year. Each 12 weeks. Last one was a disaster
* Tech lead said nothing. Walked to the board and wrote:

# 23.2%

* 12 weeks mean a year.
* stunned silence. Never known this insight. Wanted to know how. I'll show you.
* Ran to work area. Serious lego conversation.

# Stats April

* Ad-hoc biggest. Marketing (add buffer), Reports (data lake).
* Failure next. Not understanding the work (direct access), legacy code (tester)
* 4 weeks first. Fix deployments and get ready for new reporting.

# Stats November

* Doubled planned work. Failure from 1.5 days to 1.5 hours per dev per week. Ad-hoc still has value, but people could help themselves.
* Meetings 5x more. Stopped doing things wrong.

# Glasgow

* We improved performance two-fold.
* Focused on collaboration and making problems visual.
* Please note, our context was safe before we ran the Lego idea. But if safe than powerful.

Pre: Hyped up about idea. "Oh yeah, that. I don't think that will work here...."

# Rich quote

* "You can get away with a lot if you use these magic words"
* It makes big change reversible and safe to fail.
* If anything, take away that you should be relentlessly making things safer.

Pre: So remember for Monday.

# Run the experiment
