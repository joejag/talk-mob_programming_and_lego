# Mob programming

* You limit your entire team to working on one story and you stay together until it's finished.
* I know what you are thinking just now. One story? ALL the team?

joshua kerievsky quote

# Hands up

* But we have a history of counter intuitive ideas in our industry that turn out to be more efficient and effective way of writing code.

* Absurd one: Pair Programming.
* Absurd two: TDD.
* Absurd three: Limiting WIP. Mob programming.

# Woody quote

All the folk, at the same time, on the same thing, in the same space on the same computer.

# Kim 1

Can you image. All those eyes!

Jokes: Typo. Semicolon. So you think that's a good name for this method do you?

# Kim 2

It's not like this, it's a practice designed for safe working in a group - with the focus on solving problems rather than just writing as much code as possible

Jokes: Binoculars
Jokes: I wonder how many travel bans I'm on after these slides.

# Reinforce - Timer

* Take it in turns. Every 7 or so minutes you'll rotate and someone new will take the keyboard.
* The person on the keyboard is not the person driving. They are merely a typist - and the mob direct them on what to do next

# Reinforce - Strong Pairing quote

* For an idea to go from your brain to the computer, you have to use someone elses hands
* Rather than "I have an idea - give me" it's "I have an idea - please take the keyboard"

# Reinforce - Strong Pairing quote - Make it easy

Three things help -
* knowing what example scenario you are solving (whiteboard it)
* speaking at the highest level the typist can work at (extract method, highlight lines 10-14 and press Ctrl-X-M)
* Trusting the navigators, you know the example - let them direct the solution for 4 minutes - after that you can comment (Time bound trust)

# Ideal Size

* The perfect size is context specific
* Obviously there is an upper limit. Having a million people on a task.
* I've found three to four developers works well, plus anyone else needed.
* It's still worth getting together for bigger architectural items.

# Safety

* Treat each other with kindness, respect and consideration. We are putting ourselves out there and there's no room to hide.
* Handle conflict - disagree with ideas, not the person.
* If it's getting too much just take a time out.

What are the wastes?

# Wastes in software

Causes of waste in software: queues, blockers, context switching.

Queue lie at the root of of large dev problems: They increase variability, risk and cycle time. They decrease efficiency, quality and motivation.

When we work alone we tend to get blocked. When we get blocked we pick up more work. Increasing context switching. We also tend to see colleagues as too busy to bother, so we don't seek to resolve blockers as soon as they happen.

# Outcomes

Mob because the bottleneck isn't typing, it's solving problems with the smallest amount of code necessary.

# Recap - To Mob

* Mobbing isn't a meeting. It's a working agreement.

* Gather your team around a co-working space
* Limit your work in progress to one item
* Commit to creating a safe environment
* Take break
* Amplify the good
