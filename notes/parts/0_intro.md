Joined to create web services, doing fine, but couldn't get data or folk to integrate with the new services.
Asked: What team is struggling the most that I could help out?
Which was working on the point of sale system. And that is this story.

PICTURE THE SCENE!

* The PO has quit
* Three devs are working on nine cards simultaneously. Lead time over a month for most stories.
* Stand-ups are scheduled for every second Monday

TECHNICAL MESS!

* Half a million lines of code. Multi-k class files. Some converted from VB to C#
* Handful of broken tests
* No CI, deploys by hand
* All wanted to rewrite it. I don't think you should rewrite until you've fixed the behaviour that led to the mess in the first place.

TRY

* Pairing is usually ok at first - not controversial.
* Tried renaming a method with a typo: All reused.
* Tried adding analytics. Took out production.
* Tried to remove a cache. Terrified it might affect perf. (Two stages joke: high five, I have this weird bug).

ROCK DA boat

* Kaizen should be done always.
* Kanban says start where you are
* But it would take me years to help via pairing.
* But sometimes you need to rock the boat to get out of the local optima.

Come back from a conference pumped:
"Oh yeah, that. I don't think that will work here...."

"You can get away with a lot if you use these magic words"
