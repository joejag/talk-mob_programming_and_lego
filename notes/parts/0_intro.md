# Intro slide

Hello LeanAgileScotland! I'm Joe Wright and I'm over here from Glasgow to talk about a journey I've been on with a team over the last year.

From that journey I have two things to sell you today.
* Effective: The first is that I can tell you how to get teams to collaborate rather than just communicate with each other.
* Efficient: The second I'm going to tell you about is the most powerful retrospective technique I've found for improving how teams work. Which is with a set of Lego bricks like this.

In order to sell you on these ideas I'm going to tell you a story of what happened to a small development team in 2016 in Glasgow.

# Glasgow

Glasgow is my home and it's home to a car dealer called Arnold Clark, which is where our story begins.

# Car keys

I had been there a year already after leaving ThoughtWorks. After helping with one system I asked the boss level character which team needed the most help.

And they hated me and everything I stood for. So I asked where's the second biggest place I could help.

This story takes place on the team creating the point of sale system. Used by customers to purchase around 300k cars a year.

They had recently tried to double the size of the team resulting in a huge failed project that involved the team working over Christmas to fix. Needless to say morale was low.

# Paint brushes

* To paint you more of a picture
* The PO has quit
* Three devs are working on nine cards simultaneously. Lead time over a month for most stories.
* Stand-ups are scheduled for every second Monday

# TECHNICAL MESS!

* Half a million lines of code. Multi-k class files. Some converted from VB to C#
* Handful of broken tests
* No CI, deploys by hand
* All wanted to rewrite it. I don't think you should rewrite until you've fixed the behaviour that led to the mess in the first place.

# TRY TO FIX

* Pairing is usually ok at first - not controversial.
* Tried renaming a method with a typo: All reused.
* Tried adding analytics (deleteability i like software that fits in my head). Took out production.
* Silo'd knowledge.
* Fear was dominant.

# ROCK DA boat

* But it would take me years to help via pairing.
* But sometimes you need to rock the boat to get out of the local optima.

# QUESTION time

* I tried few things
