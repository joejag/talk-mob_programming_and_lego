# Back in Glasgow

* We had mobbing going.
* Disagreements about code style disappeared.
* We were building confidence in our ability to delivery bigger bits of work
* But we felt like a lot of our time was distracted on unplanned work

# How are you spending the majority of your time?

* How much time do you spend working on what is expected?
* The problem with Legacy is the tech debt.
* “We’re spending a lot of our time on bug fixes and other rework. We need a way to help our management see that if we have time to clear tech debt this drain on our time could go away permanently.”

# Calculate it

* Our challenge was how to make the nature of each week’s work more visible. Show ‘Failure demand’ and ‘Ad hoc’ work and time spent in meetings against planned work.

# 5 categories for this week…

“The front row is this week’s labor – 1 block for 1 hour. The prior 4 weeks are also on the platform.”

# Close up

“We keep this visible and it’s a great conversation-starter when managers ask about it. You can see that they’ve given us so much Ad-hoc work that we ran out of orange Legos!”

“At each daily standup, each of us will put 7 Lego together to express how our time was used yesterday.”

# Start of a new week

Take last row off; move all back

Create a blank front row

# Would this work

* Why isn’t it just as effective to store this info in a spreadsheet online?
* Would you use the same or different categories?
