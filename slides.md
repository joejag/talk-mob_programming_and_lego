> For an idea to go from your brain to the computer, you have to use someone elses hands
--Llewellyn Falco.

# Strong-style pairing

* Know what example the mob is solving
* Speak at the right level of abstraction
* The typist has to trust their navigators

## How can I get started?

---

# To mob

* Gather your team around a co-working space
* Limit your work in progress to one item
* Share one computer, rotating every 7 minutes
* Commit to creating a safe environment
* Amplify the good
